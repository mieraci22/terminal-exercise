NAME
     ls – list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated
     information.  For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory,
     as well as any requested, associated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory
     operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.

     -A      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’) except for . and ...  Automatically set for the super-user
             unless -I is specified.

     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \xxx, where
             xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     -D format
             When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the date and time output.  The argument format is a string used
             by strftime(3).  Depending on the choice of format string, this may result in a different number of columns in the output.
             This option overrides the -T option.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -F      Display a slash (‘/’) immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (‘*’) after each that is executable,
             an at sign (‘@’) after each symbolic link, an equals sign (‘=’) after each socket, a percent sign (‘%’) after each whiteout,
             and a vertical bar (‘|’) after each that is a FIFO.

     -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR or COLORTERM in the environment and setting
             --color=auto.  (See below.)  This functionality can be compiled out by removing the definition of COLORLS.  This option is
             not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).
